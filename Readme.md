A NetBeans IDE plugin which adds Markdown support. This plugin provides basic syntax highlighting, HTML preview and HTML export when editing a Markdown document.

# What is Markdown?

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
